# SkyCiv Clone 3D Model Viewer

## 📝 Project Overview

SkyCiv is a powerful cloud-based structural engineering software suite. For this hackathon, I've rebuilt their landing page with a key enhancement: integrated 3D model visualization capabilities. Engineering and architecture professionals can now directly upload structural models in STL format and interact with them in real-time 3D without leaving the browser.

### 🌟 Original Site vs. My Enhancement

**Original SkyCiv Site:**
- Cloud-based structural analysis software
- Requires users to download and install specialized viewers for 3D models
- Primarily focuses on analysis rather than visualization

**My Enhanced Version:**
- Seamless in-browser 3D model visualization
- Drag-and-drop STL file upload functionality
- Sample model library for quick demonstration
- Responsive design across all devices
- Zero installation requirements for viewing complex 3D structures

## ✨ Features

### Core Features
- **Sleek Landing Page**: Faithful recreation of SkyCiv's modern UI
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Sample Model Library**: Pre-loaded structural models to demonstrate capabilities

### New Enhancement: In-Browser 3D Model Viewer
- **Drag & Drop STL Upload**: Upload structural models with simple drag and drop
- **Interactive 3D Viewing**: Pan, zoom, and rotate models in real-time
- **Zero Installation**: No desktop software or plugins required
- **Model Library**: Access to pre-loaded structural models including buildings, cranes, and architectural landmarks

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js for WebGL-based 3D visualization
- **File Handling**: React-Dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Icons & UI Elements**: Lucide React for modern iconography
- **API Communication**: Axios for API requests
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (for file processing)

## 💻 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skyciv-model-viewer.git
   cd skyciv-model-viewer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```
VITE_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User Flow:**
    - Users visit the landing page
    - They can either select a sample model or upload their own STL file
    - Once a model is selected/uploaded, the 3D viewer loads for interactive exploration

2. **Technical Process:**
    - STL files are processed on the server
    - The viewer uses THREE.js to render 3D models in the browser
    - Responsive design ensures usability across all devices

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Material property visualization
- Stress analysis overlay
- Collaborative viewing with real-time annotations
- Export capabilities to various formats
- Integration with SkyCiv's structural analysis tools

## 📝 Hackathon Notes

This project was created for the UI Hacks 2025 hackathon. The goal was to enhance an existing website with new functionality while maintaining its visual identity and user experience. The addition of an in-browser 3D model viewer addresses a real need for engineers and architects who want to quickly visualize their structural designs without specialized software.
